# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Compact `(+N, -M)` diff stat on terminal Write/Edit completion lines (gemini-cli DenseToolMessage style): `✓ Edit src/foo.py (+12, -3)` with green/red coloring, so change size is visible at a glance without reading the full diff; stat counts the full change even when diff lines are truncated
- `/init` command: inspects the workspace (pyproject/package.json/go.mod/Cargo.toml, README, directory layout) and generates a CLAUDE.md draft shown in a panel; writes on explicit confirm (empty answer declines)
- `/model` command: lists configured providers/models with current model marked, switches provider/model mid-session (provider rebuilt like the login flow, persisted via config, status bar refreshed)
- `/mcp` command: lists configured MCP servers from ~/.clawd/mcp.json; `/mcp add <name> <command> [args...]` adds a stdio server with validation
- `/resume` command: picker over saved sessions (~/.clawd/sessions/) with timestamps, loading via the existing /load machinery
- Stop control in the browser chat: a ■ button replaces Send while a turn is running, cancelling the agent loop mid-stream or between tool calls via `POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel`; partial replies are kept in the saved chat
- Cooperative `should_stop` cancellation hook in the shared agent loop, with `AgentLoopCancelled` and an `AgentLoopResult.cancelled` flag
- Compact model picker in the browser composer: clicking the model label opens a small model-only list to switch models without opening the full settings dialog
- Nova Code-inspired workspace layout for the LAN browser UI, backed by Clawd's existing Python agent and tools
- Browser workspace controls for browsing and switching project directories, plus starting a fresh session
- Folder picker with an editable starting location and optional live, case-insensitive recursive search scoped to that folder
- Expandable in-chat tool cards showing each tool's input, result, and error state
- Animated Thinking and Typing indicators that follow model activity and streamed response text
- Nova Code-style Markdown rendering in browser chat, including formatted tables, lists, headings, links, and code blocks
- Opt-in `clawd web --reload` development mode with automatic server restart and browser refresh after Python source edits
- Initial context injection pipeline for workspace snapshot, git status, and `CLAUDE.md`
- Tests covering the new context system integration

### Changed
- Browser chat now renders tool activity as compact, expandable groups in chronological order with assistant text
- Browser composer polish: the prompt box grows with typed content instead of showing a resize grabber, and the card highlights on focus
- Saved chats are written atomically, and a truncated or corrupt session file no longer breaks the browser session list
- Skill frontmatter parsing now supports inline list syntax such as `arguments: [path]`
- README and contributor docs now prefer `uv`-based setup instructions
- Documentation now distinguishes provider-level streaming interfaces from the current turn-based CLI output

### Removed
- Redundant model text from the browser topbar and sidebar footer, and the decorative avatar squares beside assistant replies

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

#### Core Features
- Multi-provider support for Anthropic, OpenAI, and GLM (Zhipu AI)
- Interactive REPL with prompt-toolkit integration
- Rich interactive terminal output
- Session persistence and management
- Configuration management with basic API key obfuscation

#### CLI Commands
- `clawd` - Start the interactive REPL
- `clawd login` - Interactive API key configuration
- `clawd config` - View current configuration
- `clawd --version` - Show version information

#### Provider Implementations
- **Anthropic Provider**: Claude integration with chat + streaming interfaces
- **OpenAI Provider**: GPT integration with chat + streaming interfaces
- **GLM Provider**: GLM integration with chat + streaming interfaces

#### REPL Features
- Command history with persistent storage
- Auto-suggestions from history
- Slash commands: `/help`, `/exit`, `/clear`, `/save`, `/load`, `/multiline`
- Skill slash commands backed by `SKILL.md`
- Syntax highlighting with Rich library
- Tab completion and multi-line input support

#### Configuration System
- JSON-based configuration storage
- Base64-encoded API keys for basic obfuscation
- Provider-specific settings (API key, base URL, default model)
- Session auto-save option

#### Session Management
- Unique session ID generation
- Conversation history tracking
- Session save/load functionality
- Conversation clear operation

#### Code Quality
- Type hints for all public functions
- Abstract base class for provider implementations
- Data classes for structured data (ChatMessage, ChatResponse)
- Error handling and validation

#### Testing
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for providers
- End-to-end tests for REPL functionality
- Test coverage for configuration management

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
- Modular provider system with base abstraction
- Conversation management with message history
- Configuration management layer
- REPL engine with prompt-toolkit

#### Dependencies

### Known Limitations

- Context building is still in early MVP form and needs deeper project summarization
- Permission enforcement exists as a framework but is not fully integrated everywhere
- `/resume`, `/compact`, and `/doctor` are not implemented yet
- The current CLI uses turn-based output even though providers expose streaming interfaces

### Migration Notes

This is the initial MVP release. No migration needed.

### Future Roadmap

- [ ] Context enrichment and project-memory improvements
- [ ] Full permission integration
- [ ] `/resume`, `/compact`, `/doctor`
- [ ] Token usage and cost tracking
- [ ] MCP and plugin-system enhancements

## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - MVP Release

This is the first public release of Clawd Codex, a complete reimplementation of Claude Code. This MVP includes:

- Full multi-provider support
- Interactive REPL
- Session management
- Configuration system
- Tool system and agent loop foundations
- Type-safe implementation

The focus was on building a solid foundation with clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and good developer experience. All core features are working and tested.

**Special Thanks**: This project is inspired by Claude Code and aims to provide an open-source alternative for learning and experimentation.
